To install the operating system on a microsd card:
  Follow instructions found here:
    https://hackernoon.com/raspberry-pi-headless-install-462ccabd75d0
      - for our purposes, it is sufficient to choose the "Raspbian Stretch Lite" version
      - the micro SD card should be at least 8Gb -- I've been using 16Gb for most things
      
The result will be a fresh OS install on a headless RPI.  This will allow you to
communicate with it and continue setup without connecting a keyboard, mouse
and monitor.

Then, you're ready to follow my specific Touch-to-print setup instructions:
1) ssh pi@<its-ip-address>
     - password is "raspberry" by default (we will soon change that)
2) run the following 2 commands at the command line:
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install git
3) run the following command to get all the custom Touch-to-print code
     git clone https://github.com/cicchiello/t2p.git
